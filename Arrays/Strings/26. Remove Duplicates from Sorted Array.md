Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,1,2]
**Output:** 2, nums = [1,2,_]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
**Output:** 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

# Solution
If the problem states, 'in-place' when it comes to sorting you CANNOT use slices or sorting, these will create a copy and it will not be considered in place. Instead, use this form of manual sorting. The test case removes any element beyond k, so there is actually no real "removing" happening by you in this problem. 

The question is actually asking you to put all unique numbers to the front and put all of the duplicates in the back. 

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        truthDict = {}
        index = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in truthDict:
                truthDict.update({nums[i]: True})
                nums[index] = nums[i]
                index += 1

        return index
```

I used a dictionary because that is what made sense in my brain to check if something already existed in the list. 

# Alternate Solution (not by me)
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        j = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
                nums[j] = nums[i]
                j += 1
        return j
```
This does seem a lot more simple. The problem does state that nums is already sorted. So it is a fact that if the element is a duplicate, it will be the same as the element one index behind. 

This cuts down on the complexity and uses less storage.


#### What did I learn?
These in place algorithms on leetcode are kind of all the same, it has a conditional followed by a manual sort and returning the count which is conveniently the same as the index.
